Bigram Differences:

Most distinctive patterns:
"full time" appears 3 times in Corpus 1 but never in Corpus 2
"at crowdstrike" and "you to" appear twice in Corpus 2 but never in Corpus 1
Corpus 1 has more formal/business phrases: "continuous work", "work experience", "years of"
Corpus 2 has more personalized phrases: "hi oritsemisan", "and hope"
Based on these patterns, it appears that these might be different job application response letters, with Corpus 1 possibly being from BCG and Corpus 2 from Crowdstrike. The language in Corpus 2 appears to be slightly more personal and direct, while Corpus 1 contains more formal business terminology.
